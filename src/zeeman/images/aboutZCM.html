&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Zeeman Catastrophe Machine is a <a target="_new" href="http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~tony/whatsnew/column/catastrophe-0600/cusp4.html">mechanical device</a> originally created by Christopher Zeeman, before he was a knight, in order to illustrate some ideas from <a target="_new" href="http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fcarc-cusp1">catastrophe theory</a>. It consists of a wheel, free to rotate but acted on by two elastics, one of which is attached to a fixed point at the top (black circle), while the other is attached to a movable point at the bottom (blue ring). Drag the blue ring with the mouse, or move it using the arrow keys. The current simulation shows the static behavior, consisting of the equilibrium position of the wheel. If the elastic endpoint is outside the star-shaped boundary, the angle of the wheel is uniquely known, but inside the boundary there are three possible solutions. One of these solutions is dynamically unstable and never shown. Of the two stable solutions, one may disappear as you cross the boundary, leading to a discontinuous jump. Which solution you get will depend on the past history, an illustration of the phenomenon known as <a target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis">hysteresis</a>. The system also demonstrates the idea of a <a target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_theory">bifurcation</a>: position the elastic endpoint at the bottom middle of the page and drag it upwards. As it crosses the boundary, a previously stable solution becomes unstable and the wheel will jump randomly onto either the left or right branch, which diverge. This is known as a <a target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitchfork_bifurcation">pitchfork bifurcation</a>, with the middle branch being unstable.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system can also be used to demonstrate unusual <a target="_new" href="http://doi.org/10.1119/1.17906">dynamic behavior</a> when the wheel is given mass, and the elastic endpoint is moved continuously so there is no static solution, but that is a subject for another day.
